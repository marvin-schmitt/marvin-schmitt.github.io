About me
======
I am a PhD researcher in formal semantics/pragmatics. As a semanticist/pragmaticist I am studying natural language meaning. And as a formal semanticist/pragmaticist I am developing formal theories of natural language meaning. The underlying idea of formal semantics/pragmatics is the same as in any other field where formal research is conducted: We use mathematics to make precise and thus testable our theories of some phenomenon. In my case, the phenomenon is meaning.


My research and interests: TL;DR
======
Conversation Analysis, Formal Semantics/Pragmatics, Logic, Mathematics, _okay_, Philosophy of Linguistics, Speech Act theory

My research and interests
======

My research interests lie in particular with (face-to-face) conversation. Conversations are particularly interesting to linguistics, but also formal semantics/pragmatics: First, face-to-face conversations are the basic locus of language use and acquisition. Language is a primary tool in interaction therefore, but it is also the primary object of investigation of linguists. It is then natural to expect that we can learn about the nature of human languges when studying them in their primary context of use. Second, conversation is interaction. Therefore, there are sociological aspects to conversation. Third, there are cognitive and neural aspects of conversing, for much of conversing is acting on interpretations of what other do in using language.



My PhD thesis
======

I am currently working on my PhD Thesis which investigates the meaning and use of the particle _okay_ in spoken German. Here _meaning_ means what _okay_ itself contributes to the interpretation of an utterance (this is also called _lexical meaning_), while _use_ refers to what it is we are doing when making an _okay_-utterance. This _doing_ also refers to an aspect of meaning, the so-called _illocutionary act_ (in other contexts, this is simply called _(social) action_).

In a nutshell
------

I have conducted a conversation analtytic study of the video material of the Berlin-Map-Task Corpus (_BeMaTaC_) for investigating the use of the particle _okay_ in spoken German. I have identified different uses of _okay_ doing so, which are also attested in the literature, not just for German, but also for other languges, for instance American English and Swedish.

The project
------

The investigation into the meaning and use of the particle _okay_ consists of different parts:

1. Empirical investigation
  1. Data collection
  2. Data analysis
2. Theoretical Foundations
  1. Conversation Analysis and Formal semantics/pragmatics
4. Formal modelling
  1. 

The empirical investigation is based on a conversation analytic study of the Berlin-Map-Task Corpus, short _BeMaTaC_. The formal modelling consists in the development of a formal model of speech acts and speech act interpretation, as well as
