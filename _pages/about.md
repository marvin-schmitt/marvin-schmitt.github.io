About me
======
I am a PhD researcher in formal semantics/pragmatics. As a semanticist/pragmaticist I am studying natural language meaning. And as a formal semanticist/pragmaticist I am developing formal theories of natural language meaning. The underlying idea of formal semantics/pragmatics is the same as in any other field where formal research is conducted: We use mathematics to make precise and thus testable our theories of some phenomenon. In my case, the phenomenon is meaning.

My research and interests

Research
------

My research revolves around studying meaning and interpretation in (face-to-face) conversation. This interest derives from the richness of inferential phenomena in conversation, but also from the fact that conversing is a fundamental aspect of human conduct and life. In conversations, _qua_ interaction, we are performing actions. These actions have also been called _speech acts_ and are a particular instance of meaning. Our utterances are not just taken to be flows of air, but they are understood as actions, such as asking a question, answering a question, all the way to declaring war and peace. The study of conversations helps us understanding how these meanings arise and how agents come to understand utterances in certain ways. This is a central topic of both conversation analysis and pragmatics. In the former tradition, this is called _action formation and ascription_ and in pragmatics, or _speech act theory_, this may be called _speech act generation and interpretation_. These topics highlight cognitive aspects of interaction relating to cognitive aspects of meaning, in particular, interpretation processes. Such processes concern processing of information on the level of the linguistic signal, but also reasoning about knowledge, intentions, plans in context. The stuyd of different reasoning and information processing task is also interesting from a logical and mathematical view point and should always accompany research in semantics and pragmatics. In the big picture, these topics are central to understanding human life as such, because speech acts are foundational to human societies and speech act made by means of speech rely on the meaning and interpretation of language. Human life, therefore, is largely symbolic interaction on the backdrop of intersubjectively shared symbolic systems which shape and reshape our indentities and understanding of ourselves, others, and the world. In turn, our identities, conduct, understanding of others and the world reshape these symbolic systems. _Our world is mostly a symbolic world in constant motion grounded in the computational powers of our brains._ 

In my research I am combining conversation analysis, logic, mathematics, and formal semantics/pragmatics to study conversational phenomena such as the meaning and use of particles. I do this from a Marrian understanding of semantics and pragmatics, where these are computational theories, i.e., declarative theories of specific portions of the human mind. These theories are constraint by the properties of the human brain. I am valuing formal rigor and descriptive adequacy as scientific maxims. This approach is highlighted in my PhD thesis (in progress) in which I am investigating the meaning and use of the particle _okay_ in spoken German, for which see below.

Interests
------

Within linguistics, my main interests are with conversational phenomena such as speech acts, common ground, turn-taking, organization of conversation, and the phenomenon of meaning in general. This is because many of these phenomena are _deep_. They are of interest to different disciplines. Both conversation and meaning are of interest to disciplines such as anthropology, linguistics, philosophy, psychology, and sociology. But they are also of interest to disciplines such as computer science, logic, and mathematics. Furthermore, conversation and meaning are _deep_ in that they have breath to them. Answers open up new questions and/or perspectives across the different disciplines. Given the above I also have interests in sociological theory.

I am also interested into theoretical syntax, in particular into formalisms and their philosophical underpinnings, and theory of linguistics (with a focus on theoretical linguistics).

Another field of interest is sociological theory (Bourdieu, Marx, Durkheim, Weber, Habermas, Garfinkel, etc.)

I am generally interested in philosophy, particularly in theoretical philosophy and the philosophy of Immanuel Kant (which I used to read and study for countless hours during my undergraduta studies).

I am generally interested in logic and mathematics. Currently I am studying Gibert Strang's _Introduction to Linear Algebra_. I am planning on doing a undergraduate degree in mathematics after my thesis (for professional and personal reasons). 


My PhD thesis
======

I am currently working on my PhD Thesis which investigates the meaning and use of the particle _okay_ in spoken German. Here _meaning_ means what _okay_ itself contributes to the interpretation of an utterance (this is also called _lexical meaning_), while _use_ refers to what it is we are doing when making an _okay_-utterance. This _doing_ also refers to an aspect of meaning, the so-called _illocutionary act_ (in other contexts, this is simply called _(social) action_).

In a nutshell
------

I have conducted a conversation analtytic study of the video material of the Berlin-Map-Task Corpus (_BeMaTaC_) for investigating the use of the particle _okay_ in spoken German. I have identified different uses of _okay_ doing so, which are also attested in the literature, not just for German, but also for other languges, for instance American English and Swedish.

The project
------

The investigation into the meaning and use of the particle _okay_ consists of different parts:

1. Empirical investigation
  1. Data collection
  2. Data analysis
2. Theoretical Foundations
  1. Conversation Analysis and Formal semantics/pragmatics
4. Formal modelling
  1. 

The empirical investigation is based on a conversation analytic study of the Berlin-Map-Task Corpus, short _BeMaTaC_. The formal modelling consists in the development of a formal model of speech acts and speech act interpretation, as well as
