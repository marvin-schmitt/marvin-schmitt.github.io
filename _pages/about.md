About me
======
I am a PhD researcher in formal semantics/pragmatics. As a semanticist/pragmaticist I am studying natural language meaning. And as a formal semanticist/pragmaticist I am developing formal theories of natural language meaning. The underlying idea of formal semantics/pragmatics is the same as in any other field where formal research is conducted: We use mathematics to make precise and thus testable our theories of some phenomenon. In my case, the phenomenon is meaning.

When I am not working, I am most likely at the gym or eating food for two.

Research
------

My research revolves around studying meaning and interpretation in (face-to-face) conversation. This interest derives from the richness of inferential phenomena in conversation, but also from the fact that conversing is a fundamental aspect of human conduct and life. In conversations, _qua_ interaction, we are performing actions. These actions have also been called _speech acts_ and are a particular instance of meaning. Our utterances are not just taken to be flows of air, but they are understood as actions, such as asking a question, answering a question, all the way to declaring war and peace. The study of conversations helps us understanding how these meanings arise and how agents come to understand utterances in certain ways. This is a central topic of both conversation analysis and pragmatics. In the former tradition, this is called _action formation and ascription_ and in pragmatics, or _speech act theory_, this may be called _speech act generation and interpretation_. These topics highlight cognitive aspects of interaction relating to cognitive aspects of meaning, in particular, interpretation processes. Such processes concern processing of information on the level of the linguistic signal, but also reasoning about knowledge, intentions, plans in context. The stuyd of different reasoning and information processing task is also interesting from a logical and mathematical view point and should always accompany research in semantics and pragmatics. In the big picture, these topics are central to understanding human life as such, because speech acts are foundational to human societies and speech act made by means of speech rely on the meaning and interpretation of language. Human life, therefore, is largely symbolic interaction on the backdrop of intersubjectively shared symbolic systems which shape and reshape our indentities and understanding of ourselves, others, and the world. In turn, our identities, conduct, understanding of others and the world reshape these symbolic systems. _Our world is mostly a symbolic world in constant motion grounded in the computational powers of our brains._ 

In my research I am combining conversation analysis, logic, mathematics, and formal semantics/pragmatics. I have a Marrian understanding of semantics and pragmatics, where these are computational theories, i.e., declarative theories of specific portions of the human mind. These theories are constraint by the properties of the human brain, both with respect to processing and implementation. I am valuing formal rigor and descriptive adequacy as scientific maxims. This approach is highlighted in my PhD thesis (in progress) in which I am investigating the meaning and use of the particle _okay_ in spoken German, for which see below.

Interests
------

My interests are not limitted to formal semantics/pragmatics. Within linguistics, I am interested into theoretical questions of linguistics and formal semantics/pragmatics in particular, but also syntax. In syntax, I am particularly interested in formalisms and their underlying theory. Besides linguistics, I am generally interested into philosophy, with an emphasis on theoretical philosophy in the analytical tradition, but also the philosophy of Immanue Kant. Another interest of mine is sociological theory and the sociology of knowledge. Authors I am especially interested in are classics such as Durkheim, Sch√ºtz, Weber, Marx, Habermas, Bourdieu, Goffman, Garfinkel, Simmel, etc. Of course, I am also interested into logic and mathematics. This interest is of a very general nature, and since time is limited, I am spending most of my time into getting better in logic and mathematics. Currently I am studying Gibert Strang's _Introduction to Linear Algebra_. I am planning on doing a undergraduate degree in mathematics after my thesis (for both professional and personal reasons). 

My PhD thesis
======

I am currently working on my PhD Thesis which investigates the meaning and use of the particle _okay_ in spoken German. Here _meaning_ means what _okay_ itself contributes to the interpretation of an utterance (this is also called _lexical meaning_), while _use_ refers to what it is we are doing when making an _okay_-utterance. This _doing_ also refers to an aspect of meaning, the so-called _illocutionary act_ (in other contexts, this is simply called _(social) action_).

In a nutshell
------

I have conducted a conversation analtytic study of the video material of the Berlin-Map-Task Corpus (_BeMaTaC_) for investigating the use of the particle _okay_ in spoken German. I have identified different uses of _okay_ doing so, which are also attested in the literature, not just for German, but also for other languges, for instance American English and Swedish.
