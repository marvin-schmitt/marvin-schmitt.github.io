About me
======
I am a PhD researcher in formal semantics/pragmatics. As a semanticist/pragmaticist I am studying natural language meaning. And as a formal semanticist/pragmaticist I am developing formal theories of natural language meaning. The underlying idea of formal semantics/pragmatics is the same as in any other field where formal research is conducted: We use mathematics to make precise and thus testable our theories of some phenomenon. In my case, the phenomenon is meaning.

My research and interests
======

Research
------

My research revolves around studying meaning and interpretation in (face-to-face) conversation. This interest derives from the richness of inferential phenomena in conversation, but also from the fact that conversing is a fundamental aspect of human conduct and life. In conversations, _qua_ interaction, we are performing actions. These actions have also been called _speech acts_ and are a particular instance of meaning. Our utterances are not just taken to be flows of air, but they are understood as actions, such as asking a question, answering a question, all the way to declaring war and peace. The study of conversations helps us understanding how these meanings arise and how agents come to understand utterances in certain ways. This is a central topic of both conversation analysis and pragmatics. In the former tradition, this is called _action formation and ascription_ and in pragmatics, or _speech act theory_, this may be called _speech act generation and interpretation_. These topics highlight cognitive aspects of interaction relating to cognitive aspects of meaning, in particular, interpretation processes. Such processes concern processing of information on the level of the linguistic signal, but also reasoning about knowledge, intentions, and plans in context. The study of different reasoning and information processing tasks is also interesting from a logical and mathematical view point and should always accompany research in semantics and pragmatics. Formalization is a fundamental aspect of scientific work. In the big picture, these topics are central to understanding human life as such, because speech acts are foundational to human societies and speech acts made by means of speech rely on the meaning and interpretation of language. Human life, therefore, is largely symbolic interaction on the backdrop of intersubjectively shared symbolic systems (e.g., languages) which shape, reshape, and maintain our indentities and understanding of ourselves, others, and the world. In turn, these symbolic systems are shaped, reshaped, and maintained by our conduct for they serve that conduct as much as they constitute it. _Our world is mostly a symbolic world in constant motion grounded in the computational powers of our brains._ 

In my research I am combining conversation analysis, logic, mathematics, and formal semantics/pragmatics. I have a Marrian (after David Marr, the psychologist) understanding of semantics and pragmatics, where these concern computational theories, i.e., declarative theories of specific portions of the human mind. These theories are constraint by the properties of the human brain, both with respect to processing and implementation. I am valuing formal rigor and descriptive adequacy as scientific maxims. This approach is highlighted in my PhD thesis (in progress) in which I am investigating the meaning and use of the particle _okay_ in spoken German, for which see below.

Interests
------

My interests are not limitted to formal semantics/pragmatics. Within linguistics, I am interested into theoretical questions of linguistics and formal semantics/pragmatics in particular, but also syntax. In syntax, I am particularly interested in formalisms and their underlying theory. Besides linguistics, I am generally interested into philosophy, with an emphasis on theoretical philosophy (i.e., metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, but excludes ethics, etc.). In my undergraduate studies, I studied philosophy from a broad perspectives of schools and authors. I was and am still particularly interested into the analytic tradition and the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. Another interest of mine is sociological theory and the sociology of knowledge. Authors I am especially interested in are classics such as Durkheim, Sch√ºtz, Weber, Marx, Habermas, Bourdieu, Goffman, Garfinkel, Simmel, etc. Of course, I am also interested into logic and mathematics. This interest is of a very general nature, and since time is limited, I am spending most of it to getting better in logic and mathematics.

My PhD thesis
======

I am currently working on my PhD Thesis which investigates the meaning and use of the particle _okay_ in spoken German. Specifically, I am investigating what the lexical meaning of _okay_ is and what kinds of actions (speech acts) _okay_ is used to perform. This is interesting for semantics/pragmatics for different reasons. One being that _okay_ is multifunctional, meaning that _okay_ is used to perform multiple speech acts. For instance, _okay_ can be used to accept, but i can also be used to indicate transitions, completions, and even initiate question (there is more). There is then the question why _okay_ is multifunctional. There is also the question of how to systematically derive the different functions. A natural idea is to relate the multifunctionality to the meaning of _okay_, i.e., a natural hypothesis is to say that the meaning of _okay_ allows for different uses. The multifunctionality of _okay_ is directly of interest for speech act theory, because _okay_ can be used for performing different kinds of speech acts. We can thus learn about these different acts by studying _okay_. Similarly, we can use _okay_-responses as a window into other speech acts. Studying _okay_ in its conversational context also hihglights the role of prosody for deriving the different functions of _okay_. Therefore, this kind of research provides to research at the prosoy-meaning interface. Another reason why this study of _okay_ is interesting are what we may call _particle systems_. Such systems are collections of particles. Th study of particle systems reveals details about similarities of particles across the dimensions of lexical meaning, but also functions. In fact, the previously highlighted points all apply to the study of particle systems. They thus encompass the earlier points, while also adding new questions.

Based on a conversation analtytic study of the video material of the Berlin-Map-Task Corpus (_BeMaTaC_) for investigating the use of the particle _okay_ in spoken German, I am arguing that _okay_ has a single lexical meaning underlying all its different uses. This meaning consists in indicating truth of propositions. I am spelling this out formally in terms of truth predicates using type-free systems (first-order logics with self-reference and truth schemes). Such type-free systems are also used to formulate a formal model of action ascription and formation, which is needed to derive the different uses of _okay_.
