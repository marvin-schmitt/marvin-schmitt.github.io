About me
======
I am a PhD researcher in formal semantics/pragmatics. As a semanticist/pragmaticist I am studying natural language meaning. And as a formal semanticist/pragmaticist I am developing formal theories of natural language meaning. The underlying idea of formal semantics/pragmatics is the same as in any other field where formal research is conducted: We use mathematics to make precise and thus testable our theories of some phenomenon. In my case, the phenomenon is meaning.

My research and interests
======

My research revolves around studying meaning in (face-to-face) conversation. The human conduct of conversing is of interest to me as a formal semanticist/pragamticist for different reasons. Here are two big points from that list:

1. Conversations are interactions between social agents. In conversations, _qua_ interaction, we are performing actions. These actions have also been called _speech acts_ and are a particular instance of meaning. Our utterances are not just taken to be flows of air, but they are understood as actions, such as asking a question, answering a question, all the way to declaring war and peace. The study of conversations helps us understanding how these meanings arise and how agents come to understand utterances in certain ways. This is a central topic of both conversation analysis and pragmatics. In the former tradition, this is called _action formation and ascription_ and in pragmatics, or _speech act theory_, this may be called _speech act generation and interpretation_. In the big picture, these topics are central to understanding human life as such, because speech acts are foundational to human societies. Human life is on the large scale symbolic interaction on the backdrop of intersubjectively shared symbolic systems which shape and reshape our indentities and understanding of ourselves and others. Our world is mostly a symbolic world.
2. The first point already hints at another dimension, the cognivite underpinnings of social interaction. Social interaction is conduct based on interpretation, hence, information processing. Interpretation as a formal and cognitive process is central to formal semantics and pragmatics as both disciplines study meaning in relation to interpretation, which is understood as information processing. 





4. Conversations are not just instances of interactions between social agents. These agents are cognitive agents. This is crucial, for most of conversation is action based on interpretation, and interpretation is a complicated cognitive process. Of particular interest to both semantics and pragmatics are aspects of interpretation concerned with meaning. On an aside, interpretation as a cognitive process is information processing, and this makes interpretation a phenomenon interesting to logic, mathematics, and computer science.

In a slogan _The linguistic study of conversation is the study of grammar in the context of cognition and social interaction_

In my research I am combining conversation analysis, logic, mathematics, and formal semantics/pragmatics to study conversational phenomena such as the meaning and use of particles. I am valuing formal rigor and descriptive adequacy as scientific maxims. This approach is highlighted in my PhD thesis (in progress) in which I am investigating the meaning and use of the particle _okay_ in spoken German, for which see below.




My PhD thesis
======

I am currently working on my PhD Thesis which investigates the meaning and use of the particle _okay_ in spoken German. Here _meaning_ means what _okay_ itself contributes to the interpretation of an utterance (this is also called _lexical meaning_), while _use_ refers to what it is we are doing when making an _okay_-utterance. This _doing_ also refers to an aspect of meaning, the so-called _illocutionary act_ (in other contexts, this is simply called _(social) action_).

In a nutshell
------

I have conducted a conversation analtytic study of the video material of the Berlin-Map-Task Corpus (_BeMaTaC_) for investigating the use of the particle _okay_ in spoken German. I have identified different uses of _okay_ doing so, which are also attested in the literature, not just for German, but also for other languges, for instance American English and Swedish.

The project
------

The investigation into the meaning and use of the particle _okay_ consists of different parts:

1. Empirical investigation
  1. Data collection
  2. Data analysis
2. Theoretical Foundations
  1. Conversation Analysis and Formal semantics/pragmatics
4. Formal modelling
  1. 

The empirical investigation is based on a conversation analytic study of the Berlin-Map-Task Corpus, short _BeMaTaC_. The formal modelling consists in the development of a formal model of speech acts and speech act interpretation, as well as
